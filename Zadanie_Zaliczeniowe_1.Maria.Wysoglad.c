/*
"Polynomials"

This project is the polynomial calculator with two operations: addition and multiplication.
Maximum degree of polynomial that might be counted by this caltulator is 10.
Polynomials coefficients might be represented as integers (type int).
There is storage cell which contains previous counted polynomial.
At the beginning polynomial is equal 0.
